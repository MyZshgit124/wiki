## Welcome to Oh My Zsh!

- You'll need `zsh` to install **Oh My Zsh**. Run `zsh --version` to check if you have it:

  ```console
  $ zsh --version
  zsh 5.8 (x86_64-ubuntu-linux-gnu)
  ```

- If you see `command not found` you don't have zsh installed. See [Installing Zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/wiki/blob/main/Installing-ZSH.md) for instructions.
- Once you have zsh, you can install Oh My Zsh by simply running one of these commands:
